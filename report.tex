\section{Denominations of the disease}

CANDLE disease is an acronym for \textit{Chronic Atypical Neutrophilic Dermatosis with Lipodystrophy and Elevated temperature}. This name was set by Torrelo et al. in 2010 \cite{Torrelo2010}.
However, this disease was previously described as \textit{Joint contractures, Muscle atrophy, Microcytic anemia and Panniculitis induced lipodystrophy (JMP)}, \textit{Japanese Autoinflammatory Syndrome with Lipodystrophy} and \textit{Nakajo-Nishimura Syndrome}.
